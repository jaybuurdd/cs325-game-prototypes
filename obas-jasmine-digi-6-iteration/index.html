<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?

<p><b>I learned how to create a specific game mechanic and how to use the physcis mechanics in phaser as well as how to implement certain functions to create a never ending loop
and how to recycle assets so the setup is never ending but switch positions to add challange to the game. 
</b></p>

What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?

<p><b>The easiest part was adding the techinical mechanics of the player moving forward and bouncing on the users clicks. The hardest part was setting up the pipes to keep recycling and not end after the 4 sets of pipes
it was orginally set to.</b></p>
